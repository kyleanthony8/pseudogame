A Fun Computer Knowledge Trivia Game

'Pseudo' is a trivia game for programming and computer knowledge.

Players must answer 10 difficult multiple choice programming questions. A score is kept as correct answers are tallied up. 

Technically I'm using (4) API's that I've cited below:

The questions are populated dynamically via JSON using the OpenTDB API.

After a game which lasts 10 questions, a user may input their name and their score is automatically stored in the browser using the localstorage method.

Clearing the browsers cache will refresh the localstorage.
